<P>
1. Use the scratch paper
to work out each problem.
<P>
2.For some tests you may use a calculator and for some tests you may NOT.<br>
The instructions at the beginning of each test will tell you whether or not
a calculator is allowed.<br>
You may borrow a calculator from the Testing Office if you need one.

<P>
3. If you do not know an answer
to a question, please <U>do not guess</U>!  That is because this
test is a placement test, and you are trying to find your true
level of performance in order to choose the best class.  If you
reach problems that are too difficult, you may stop.
<p>

You are allowed ONE retest on each part, and then must wait three months for an additional attempt.<br>
Clicking on a link below, will count as an attempt, even if you don't answer any of the questions.<p>
